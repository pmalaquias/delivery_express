![progress](https://www.animatedimages.org/data/media/1635/animated-walking-image-0052.gif)

## How to used

### Prerequisites

* [Flutter 3](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) or higher installed on machne
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control

### How to clone code from GitHub

In the terminal in the destination folder that you want to clone, and with Git previously installed on the machine, and with the SSH key configured, type:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:pmalaquias/delivery_express.git
```

### Project Installation

When cloning the project from the repository, and then opening it on a machine with the minimum prerequisites listed on the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) website, you must run the following terminal command:

```` bash
flutter pub get
````

### Running the project

And with the Android or iPhone emulator, in the terminal run the command:

```` bash
flutter run
````

### Internationalization

Delivery Express currently supports three languages: English, Portuguese and Spanish, and is open to collaboration to add new languages so it can be more accessible to everyone.

Translation files are in the l10n folder with `.arb` file extension, similar in structure to `.json`. As explained in Flutter documentation from , `.arb`  files are generated by the following command:

```` bash
flutter gen-l10n
````
Retrieving a `.dart` file for use within the application and calling the parts you want to translate:

```` dart
 AppLocalizations.of(context)!.<keyword>
````

And hot reload ‚ö°

## Technologies

Flutter is used in this project, a Cross-platform framework written in Dart, created by Google in 2017. This technology was chosen for its versatility, ease of use, code maintenance and other amenities, and it is on the rise in the world of development.

For the layout of the App, Figma was used.

Google Maps API (Application Programming Interface) is also used to obtain the user's location and map display in the application and Firebase for data storage and user login/Signup.

With the announcement that [Flutter now supports Material You (Material 3)](https://medium.com/flutter/whats-new-in-flutter-3-8c74a5bc32d0) made by Google at [Google I/O 2022](https://io.google/2022/intl/pt/), it was chosen to use the feature that left the design more modern and minimalist.
As Delivery Express was initially developed with Flutter version 2.10.1 it was upgraded to Flutter 3 without much trouble.

## Specifications

### App Logo

It's pretty simple, it's the Deliverator with the app's main color with an elevation to give a drop shadow effect.

### Colors Used

For the colors, the main color was used from the original design. But with the release of Material 3, a tool for harmonizing colors and dynamic colors was launched, the [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/#/custom).

Primary color is: **#b91d1d**

So we have as a result:

### Fonts Used

The following fonts are currently used in this project:

* Montserrat[^1]
* Quick Express[^2]

Where the first is used in every app and in the logo, and the second mentioned is only used in the app logo on the login page, to get dynamics for different screen sizes.

[^1]: Montserrat has an [Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL), obtained from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat).
[^2]: Quick Express has an unknown license, and was obtained from [Font Meme](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/quick-express-font/).
